# negotiation-market-simulator
A browser-based simulation where virtual buyers and sellers negotiate over items across multiple rounds. Each agent follows a strategy (e.g., aggressive, fair, opportunistic). The simulator runs ticks (rounds), produces deals (or deadlocks), and visualizes outcomes (prices, surplus, fairness, efficiency)
